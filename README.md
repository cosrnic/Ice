# ðŸ§Š Ice
A collection of vanilla-like placement rules for [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom).

## Usage
Just copy the `rules` directory located [here](https://github.com/cosrnic/Ice/tree/master/src/main/java/dev/cosrnic/ice) into your project!

## Customising
You can easily customise the rules by just modifying the code.
Want to be able to place buttons on fences? just modify the `canPlaceAt` method in [GenericBlockPlacementRule](https://github.com/cosrnic/Ice/tree/master/src/main/java/dev/cosrnic/ice/rules/utils/GenericBlockPlacementRule.java) or override it in [ButtonRule](https://github.com/cosrnic/Ice/blob/master/src/main/java/dev/cosrnic/ice/rules/ButtonRule.java)!

This may not be 100% accurate, if you want to improve the accuracy feel free to [fork](https://github.com/cosrnic/Ice/fork) and make a [pull request](https://github.com/cosrnic/ice/pulls). The rules are based off of vanilla's code.
